```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

"Enumerate graphs and partition" is a pdf vignette. At present, `pkgdown` does 
not support pdf vignettes; see 
[pkgdown issue 781](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/781). 
When Pv3Rs is on CRAN, this signpost will be replaced by a link to the pdf
vignette on CRAN. For the time being, please access "Enumerate graphs and
partition" by calling `vignette(topic = "enumerate", package = "Pv3Rs")` within
`R`.
