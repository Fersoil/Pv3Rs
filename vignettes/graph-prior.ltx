\section{Posterior bounds that are induced by the graph prior}

When the prior probability on relapse is non-zero, posterior probabilities of reinfection and recrudescence never reach one because genetic data compatible with either recrudescence or reinfection are also compatible with relapse. In this section we discuss bounds on posterior probabilities of reinfection and recrudescence; they are induced by the uniformity of the prior over relationship graphs. Bounds define a feasible set of posterior probabilities without any information about the genetic data beyond that used to derive the multiplicities of infection (MOIs). For example, in the case of two genotypes in an enrolment episode followed by a monoclonal recurrence, when recurrent states are equally likely \textit{a priori}, the posterior probabilities of reinfection and recrudescence are upper bounded by $\sfrac{9}{11}$ and $\sfrac{9}{13}$, respectively. The feasible set of posterior probabilities is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:feasible}.

\end{SCfigure}

\subsection{How bounds are derived}

We start by making some observations about the posterior odds of relapse to reinfection / recrudescence; odds help simplify some derivations. 

\subsubsection{Single recurrence}

For clarity of exposition, we start with the case of a single recurrent episode. Let $\RG_\recru, \RG_\relap,$ and $\RG_\reinf$ denote subsets of the graph space $\RG$, containing the relationship graphs compatible with recrudescence, relapse, and reinfection respectively. The posterior odds of relapse to recrudescence is given by

\small
\begin{equation*}
o_{\relap:\recru} \coloneqq 
\frac{\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \relap)\mathbb{P}(\relap)}{\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \recru)\mathbb{P}(\recru)} =
\frac{\mathbb{P}(\relap)}{\mathbb{P}(\recru)}
\frac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\relap}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)\mathbb{P}(\rg | \relap)}{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\recru}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)\mathbb{P}(\rg | \recru)} =
\frac{\mathbb{P}(\relap)}{\mathbb{P}(\recru)}
\frac{| \RG_\recru |}{| \RG_\relap |} \frac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\relap}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\recru}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)} = 
\frac{\mathbb{P}(\relap)}{\mathbb{P}(\recru)}
\frac{| \RG_\recru |}{| \RG_\relap |} \left(1 + \frac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\relap\setminus\RG_\recru}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\recru}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}\right), 
\end{equation*}
\normalsize

where $\RG_\relap\setminus\RG_\recru$ is the subset of graphs compatible with relapse but not recrudescence (graphs where genotypes from the recurrent episode are not all clones from the initial episode). It follows that $o_{\relap:\recru} \ge 
\sfrac{\mathbb{P}(\relap)| \RG_\recru |}
{\mathbb{P}(\recru)| \RG_\relap |}$. Note that this inequality is close to equality when $\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\relap\setminus\RG_\recru}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) \ll \sum_{\rg\in\RG_\recru}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)$.


Similarly, the posterior odds of relapse to reinfection is given by
\begin{equation*}
o_{\relap:\reinf} \coloneqq 
\frac{\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \relap)\mathbb{P}(\relap)}{\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \reinf)\mathbb{P}(\reinf)} = 
\frac{\mathbb{P}(\relap)}{\mathbb{P}(\reinf)}
\frac{| \RG_\reinf |}{| \RG_\relap |} \left(1 + \frac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\relap\setminus\RG_\reinf}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\reinf}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}\right).
\end{equation*}
It follows that $o_{\relap:\reinf} \ge 
\sfrac{\mathbb{P}(\relap)| \RG_\reinf |}
{\mathbb{P}(\reinf)| \RG_\relap |}$. Note that this inequality is close to equality when $\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\relap\setminus\RG_\reinf}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) \ll \sum_{\rg\in\RG_\reinf}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)$.

The posterior odds $o_{\reinf:\recru}$ can be defined similarly, but analogous lower bounds are not available. This is because $\RG_\recru$ and $\RG_\reinf$ do not intersect. Thus, we simply note that $o_{\reinf:\recru} \approx 0$ when $\mathbb{P}(\bm{y}|\reinf) \ll \mathbb{P}(\bm{y}\recru)$.

As for the posterior probabilities, we have
\begin{align} 
\mathbb{P}(\recru | \bm{y}) 
&= \frac{\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \recru)\mathbb{P}(\recru)}{\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \recru)\mathbb{P}(\recru)+\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \relap)\mathbb{P}(\relap)+\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \reinf)\mathbb{P}(\reinf)} \nonumber\\
&= \frac{1}{1+o_{\relap:\recru}+o_{\reinf:\recru}} \nonumber\\
&\le \dfrac{1}{1+\frac{\mathbb{P}(\relap)| \RG_\recru |} 
{\mathbb{P}(\recru)| \RG_\relap |}+0}
\nonumber\\
&= \dfrac{\mathbb{P}(\recru)}
{\mathbb{P}(\recru) + 
\mathbb{P}(\relap)\frac{|\RG_\recru|}{|\RG_\relap|}}.  \label{eq:recru_prob_max}
\end{align}
This inequality is close to equality when $\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\relap\setminus\RG_\recru}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) \ll \sum_{\rg\in\RG_\recru}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\bm{y}|\reinf) \ll \mathbb{P}(\bm{y}|\recru)$. Note that the former implies the latter as $\RG_\reinf \subseteq \RG_\relap\setminus\RG_\recru$. 

Similarly, we have
\begin{equation} 
\mathbb{P}(\reinf | \bm{y}) 
\le\dfrac{\mathbb{P}(\reinf)}
{\mathbb{P}(\reinf) + 
\mathbb{P}(\relap)\frac{|\RG_\reinf|}{|\RG_\relap|}}.  \label{eq:reinf_prob_max}
\end{equation}
Likewise, this inequality is close to equality when $\sum_{\rg\in\RG_\relap\setminus\RG_\reinf}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) \ll \sum_{\rg\in\RG_\reinf}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)$.

\subsubsection{More than one recurrence}

When there is more than one recurrence and prior probabilities are non-zero, the maximum probabilities of all sequences are non-certain with the exception of the relapse-only sequence. As before, we can compute odds; for example
\begin{align*}
o_{\relap\relap:\recru\relap} \coloneqq
\frac{\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \relap\relap)\mathbb{P}(\relap\relap)}{\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \recru\relap)\mathbb{P}(\recru\relap)} =
\frac{\mathbb{P}(\relap\relap)}{\mathbb{P}(\recru\relap)}
\frac{| \RG_{\recru\relap} |}{| \RG_{\relap\relap} |} \frac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\relap\relap}}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\relap}}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)} = 
\frac{\mathbb{P}(\relap\relap)}{\mathbb{P}(\recru\relap)}
\frac{| \RG_{\recru\relap} |}{| \RG_{\relap\relap} |} \left(1 + \frac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\relap\relap}\setminus\RG_{\recru\relap}}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\relap}}\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}\right).
\end{align*}
However, unlike before, we cannot always derive maximum posterior probabilities from the odds because the probabilities of the remaining sequences are not necessarily zero (the exception being when the odds of a all-but-one-relapse to all-relapse sequence are maximised). Instead, we must compute maximum probabilities the long way; for example,
\begin{align} 
    \mathbb{P}(\recru\recru | \bm{y}) = 
    &\left\{
    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\recru}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) 
    \sfrac{\mathbb{P}(\recru\recru)}{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|} 
    \right\} \left\{
    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\recru}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) 
    \sfrac{\mathbb{P}(\recru\recru)}{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}  
    + \left(
    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\recru}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) + 
    \smashoperator{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\relap\recru}\setminus\RG_{\recru\recru}}} 
    \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)
    \right) \frac{\mathbb{P}(\relap\recru)}{|\RG_{\relap\recru}|}
    \right.  \nonumber \\ 
    + &\left. 
    \left(
    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\recru}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) +
    \smashoperator{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\relap\relap}\setminus\RG_{\recru\recru}}}
    \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) \right) \frac{\mathbb{P}(\relap\relap)}{|\RG_{\relap\relap}|} 
    + 
    \left(
    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\recru}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) +
    \smashoperator{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\relap}\setminus\RG_{\recru\recru}}}
    \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) \right) \frac{\mathbb{P}(\recru\relap)}{|\RG_{\recru\relap}|}
    + \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\reinf}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) 
    \sfrac{\mathbb{P}(\recru\reinf)}{|\RG_{\recru\reinf}|} +
    \right. \nonumber \\ 
    + &\left. 
    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\relap\reinf}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) 
    \sfrac{\mathbb{P}(\relap\reinf)}{|\RG_{\relap\reinf}|} + 
    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\reinf\recru}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) 
    \sfrac{\mathbb{P}(\reinf\recru)}{|\RG_{\reinf\recru}|} + 
    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\reinf\relap}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) 
    \sfrac{\mathbb{P}(\reinf\relap)}{|\RG_{\reinf\relap}|} + 
    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\reinf\reinf}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) 
    \sfrac{\mathbb{P}(\reinf\reinf)}{|\RG_{\reinf\reinf}|} 
    \right\}^{-1} \label{eq:CC_prob_max}
\end{align}
converges to 
\begin{equation*} 
\dfrac{
\mathbb{P}(\recru\recru)}{
\mathbb{P}(\recru\recru) + 
\mathbb{P}(\relap\recru)\frac{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}{|\RG_{\relap\recru}|} + 
\mathbb{P}(\relap\relap)\frac{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}{|\RG_{\relap\relap}|} + 
\mathbb{P}(\recru\relap)\frac{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}{|\RG_{\recru\relap}|}}  
\end{equation*}
when $\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\recru}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)$ significantly exceeds the summation over all other subsets of graph space in equation \eqref{eq:CC_prob_max}. 

Bounds on marginal posteriors are harder to compute because computation involves summation over sequences whose probabilities are not necessarily zero. For example, the bound on recrudescence at the first recurrence of two recurrences, is a maximum of three upper bounds each involving non-zero probabilities: the bound when 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the probability of CC is maximal and the probabilities of CI \& CL are not necessarily both zero. 
    \item the probability of CL is maximal and the probabilities of CC \& CI are not necessarily both zero. 
    \item  the probability of CI is maximal and the probabilities of CC \& CL are not necessarily both zero
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Digression}
In the subsection ``Increasing episode counts'' of the vignette entitled ``Understand posterior estimates'' we compute maximum marginal probabilities of recrudescence / reinfection at the first recurrence of two / three recurrences. These maxima are not bounds imposed by the prior: they are based on knowledge that there are no recurrent data on all but the first recurrence. The computation only holds because all episodes are monoclonal. When all episodes are monoclonal, equivalent sequences (e.g., CC, CI and CL in the case of two recurrences with strong evidence of recrudescence on the first and no data on the second) are equal. Otherwise (for reasons analogous to those that explain departure from the prior in the section ``Data on only one episode) they are unequal. In addition, when all episodes are monoclonal, graph likelihoods are equal for all graphs compatible with equivalent sequences, e.g., $\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)$ is the same for all $\rg \in \RG_{\recru\recru}$, for all $\rg \in \RG_{\recru\reinf}$ and for all $\rg \in \RG_{\recru\relap}$. As such, the factor $\mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)$ drops out of the upper bound and we can express the probability for a given sequence as a ratio of graph spaces. For example, given a uniform prior on recurrent states, the posterior probability of CC given strong evidence of recrudescence for the first recurrence and no data on the second recurrence is 
\begin{align}
  &\leq
    \dfrac{
    \sfrac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\recru}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) }{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}}
    {
    \dfrac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\recru}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}  
    + 
    \dfrac{    \sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\reinf}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) }{|\RG_{\recru\reinf}|}  
    +  
    \dfrac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\relap}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg) }{|\RG_{\recru\relap}|}

    +
    \dfrac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\reinf}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}{|\RG_{\relap\reinf}|} 
    +
    \dfrac{\sum_{\rg\in\RG_{\recru\relap}} \mathbb{P}(\bm{y} | \rg)}{|\RG_{\relap\relap}|}
  } \nonumber \\
  &=
    \dfrac{\sfrac{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}}
    {
    \dfrac{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}  
    + 
    \dfrac{|\RG_{\recru\reinf}|}{|\RG_{\recru\reinf}|}  
    +
    \dfrac{|\RG_{\recru\relap}|}{|\RG_{\recru\relap}|}  
    +
    \dfrac{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}{|\RG_{\relap\recru}|}  
    +  
    \dfrac{|\RG_{\recru\reinf}|}{|\RG_{\relap\reinf}|}
    +   
    \dfrac{|\RG_{\recru\relap}|}{|\RG_{\relap\relap}|}
  } \nonumber \\
  &= \dfrac{1}
  {3 + \sfrac{1}{3} + \sfrac{1}{3} + \sfrac{3}{12}}. \label{eq:marginal_bound}
\end{align}




\section{Bounds as indicators of data informativeness}

By comparing probability estimates to their respective bounds, we might like to answer the question: could the posterior probability of my most probable state sequence be higher if I added data on more markers? However, we cannot guarantee convergence onto bounds. In the case of a marginal probability, the bound is the maximum of multiple upper bounds (see example above), and thus convergence is not guaranteed; in the case of a non-marginal probability, we suspect convergence might depend on the true relationship graph on which data are conditioned.  



\section{How bounds induced by the graph prior change with MOI}

In this section we explore how maximum probabilities of recrudescence / reinfection given a single recurrence change with graph size, where maximum probabilities are those induced by the the graph prior. Maximum probabilities of reinfection increase with the size of the graph, both when MOIs of the enrolment episode and the first recurrence are equal (plot \ref{fig:MOIDiff_reinfection}, centre) and not (plot \ref{fig:MOIDiff_reinfection}, off-centre). Maximum probabilities of recrudescence increase with graph size when the MOIs of the enrolment episode and the first recurrence are equal (plot \ref{fig:MOIDiff_recrudescence}, centre); they decrease with increasing disparity between the higher MOI of the enrolment episode and the lower MOI of the first recurrence (plot \ref{fig:MOIDiff_recrudescence}, right of centre). Note that, when the MOI of first recurrence exceeds that of the enrolment episode, recrudescence has zero posterior probability because it is assumed under the Pv3Rs model that all parasites are detected and there are no genotyping errors; as such, a recrudescence can be at most as diverse as the preceding episode.

\section{A counter-intuitive property}

% See DevFiles/GenerateDistributionOverEdge.R for graph counts featuring in eq 8 - 10

The \textit{a priori} assumption that all valid relationships graphs $\rg$ are equally likely given a recurrent state leads to a counter-intuitive property. Specifically, the probability of an edge can vary depending on the graph it is embedded within. Consider the scenario where one monoclonal recurrence follows a monoclonal enrolment episode. 
%(Example \ref{ex:simplest_het})
Because we assume that the three relationship graphs are equally likely given relapse, the probability distribution of the edge between the two genotypes given relapse is
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{P}(\text{the two genotypes are clones}\vert\bm{s}=\relap) &= \sfrac{1}{3},
    \label{eq: 1st two C gvn L}\\
    \mathbb{P}(\text{the two genotypes are siblings}\vert\bm{s}=\relap) &= \sfrac{1}{3},\\
    \mathbb{P}(\text{the two genotypes are strangers}\vert\bm{s}=\relap) &= \sfrac{1}{3}. 
\end{align}
Now consider the scenario in which there is an additional monoclonal recurrence. 
%(Example \ref{ex:multiple_recurs_het}). 
There are now 12 relationship graphs, which are assumed to be equally likely under relapses. Among them, between the first two genotypes, three have a clonal edge, four have a sibling edge, and five have a stranger edge. The probability distribution of the edge between the first two genotypes given relapses is thus
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{P}(\text{the first two genotypes are clones}\vert\bm{s}=\relap\relap) &= \sfrac{3}{12},
    \label{eq: 1st two C gvn LL}\\
    \mathbb{P}(\text{the first two genotypes are siblings}\vert\bm{s}=\relap\relap) &= \sfrac{4}{12},\\
    \mathbb{P}(\text{the first two genotypes are strangers}\vert\bm{s}=\relap\relap) &= \sfrac{5}{12}.
\end{align}

An explanation for the change in the probability distribution of the edge between the first two genotypes upon the addition of the second relapse is that a clonal edge between the first two genotypes imposes a constraint where the two remaining edges must exhibit the same relationship. Similarly, a sibling edge between the first two genotypes is incompatible with a single stranger edge among the two remaining edges. In general, the pattern that stranger edges are more likely \textit{a priori} and clonal edges are less likely \textit{a priori} becomes more prominent when more genotypes are present. For monoclonal episodes, this change in distribution over the edge between the first two genotypes results in an increase / decrease in the maximum probability that the first recurrence is a recrudescence / reinfection with the addition of monoclonal recurrences devoid of data (Figure \ref{fig:monoclonal_recurrences}), where the maximum probabilities are those assuming all episodes are monoclonal and there are no recurrent data on all but the first recurrence (e.g., as in equation \eqref{eq:marginal_bound}). 

\begin{SCfigure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/maxima3.png}
    \caption{The probability that the first recurrence is a recrudescence / reinfection increases / decreases with additional recurrences devoid of data. The prior on recurrent states is uniform. The maximum probabilities are those based on knowledge that there are no recurrent data for all but the first recurrence and all episodes are monoclonal. For example, from equations \eqref{eq: 1st two C gvn L} and \eqref{eq: 1st two C gvn LL} we have $\sfrac{|\RG_\recru|}{|\RG_\relap|} = \sfrac{1}{3} > \sfrac{|\RG_{\recru\relap}|}{|\RG_{\relap\relap}|} = \sfrac{3}{12}$. Plugging $\sfrac{|\RG_\recru|}{|\RG_\relap|} = \sfrac{1}{3}$ into equation \eqref{eq:recru_prob_max}, and $\sfrac{|\RG_{\recru\relap}|}{|\RG_{\relap\relap}|} = \sfrac{3}{12}$ plus $\sfrac{|\RG_{\recru\recru}|}{|\RG_{\relap\recru}|} = \sfrac{1}{3}$ and $\sfrac{|\RG_{\recru\reinf}|}{|\RG_{\relap\reinf}|} = \sfrac{1}{3}$ into equation \eqref{eq:marginal_bound}, we see that the probability that the first recurrence is a recrudescence when recurrent states are equally likely \textit{a priori} increases slightly from $\sfrac{3}{4}$ to $\sfrac{3}{\left(3 + \sfrac{11}{12}\right)}$ with the addition of the second recurrence without data.}
    \label{fig:monoclonal_recurrences}
\end{SCfigure}

%Consider a second example of a counter-intuitive property induced by the uniformity of the prior over transitive relationship graphs, this time with multiple genotypes per episode. Suppose that there is a reinfection episode with MOI one after an initial episode with MOI $M\ge 2$. Since we have a reinfection, all inter-episode edges must be stranger edges. The number of valid relationship graphs is the $M$-th Bell number $B_M$, since each relationship graph is equivalent to partitioning the genotypes in the initial episode by sibling relationships. We now consider the probability that the first two genotypes in the initial episode are siblings. The number of relationship graphs where the first two genotypes are siblings is $B_{M-1}$, since we can ignore one of the first two genotypes for enumeration purposes. Thus, the probability that the first two genotypes are siblings is $\sfrac{B_{M-1}}{B_M}$, which is asymptotically $\mathcal{O}(1/M)$ as $M\rightarrow\infty$. Arguably, this probability should not vanish as $M\rightarrow\infty$, at least not for a single inoculation of many parasite. (For $M\rightarrow\infty$ with the number of bites $n_b\rightarrow\infty$, the overall proportion of sibling comparisons might approach zero but at a different rate: for example, if on average a mosquito co-transmits $n_s$ siblings among $n_p$ parasites per bite and $M$ increases with the number of bites $n_b$, we could argue the overall proportion of sibling comparisons within an infection should be $\sfrac{\left(n_b \binom{n_p}{2} \right)}{\binom{n_b n_p}{2}}$.)
